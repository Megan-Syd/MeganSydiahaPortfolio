      "Over the course of two months I apprenticed with a small team of developers to begin work on a registration software for swing dance events. I worked on the front-end of the app, recreating a pre-existing app's UI with Material UI and Styled Components, and building the behaviour with Next.js and the react-hook-form library. The apprenticeship experience gave me valuable insight into the daily life of a professional developer working on a team, an introduction to several interesting technologies, and confirmed that I have the skills and understanding to enter the workforce.",

      "This React project was a collaborative work between myself and two of my classmates. Our challenge was to make use of a public API through Typescript React, and display the provided data with Chakra UI. Through this project I was able to learn about lots of the cool UI secrets I've seen and admired online, but hadn't yet been able to execute. ",

      "I built this classic dice-rolling game as a means to learn about routing. I used Bootstrap along with some custom colours and fonts to create an eye-catching and retro look and feel. This program was also used as a way to test out deploying a virtual machine via AWS, which made Python the obvious choice of language.",

      "This app was a first foray into building a more complex app with the use of Laravel. I love the process of creating database schemas, and I love front-end design, so this project was especially fun. As it was built earlier on, it doesn't have all the functionalities that I dreamed of including, but as I progress in my learning I am excited to delve further into the possibilities of this interesting framework.",
