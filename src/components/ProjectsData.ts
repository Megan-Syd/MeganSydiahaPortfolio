      "This React project was a collaborative work between myself and two of my classmates. Our challenge was to make use of a public API through Typescript React, and display the provided data with Chakra UI.

      "This app was a first foray into building a more complex app with the use of Laravel. I love the process of creating database schemas, and I love front-end design, so this project was especially fun. As it was built earlier on, it doesn't have all the functionalities that I dreamed of including, but as I progress in my learning I am excited to delve further into the possibilities of this interesting framework.",
