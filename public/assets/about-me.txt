I'm a full-stack web developer who loves to solve puzzles. As someone who embraces both sides of her brain, I love the way that web design does the same, combining logic and creativity, functionality and art.

My goal is to utilize the skills I have gained in my acedemic and workplace training to create beautiful and functional applications.

If I'm not coding, I'm probably dancing, teaching, cooking, gaming, or watching television, somewhere in Montreal.
