I'm a full-stack web developer who loves to solve puzzles. As someone who embraces both sides of her brain, I love the way that web design does the same, combining logic and creativity, functionality and art.

My current dream is to find an intership that will allow me to fully dive in to the world of front-end or full-stack web development. 

If I'm not coding, I'm probably dancing, teaching, cooking, gaming, or watching television, somewhere in Montreal.
